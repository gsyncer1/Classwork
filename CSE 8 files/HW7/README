HOW TO RUN
	The program shows various results of different manipulations of text
	from a file that the user desires.
	The program asks the user if they want to play a game. Enter any
	character to play, otherwise enter the EOF keyboard sequence.
	If the user wants to play, the program prompts the user for a file 
	name.
	The program will then print a menu of various things the user can
	do with the text from the file. Enter the number corresponding
	to the thing the user wants to have done.

	Entering 1 removes the shorter strings of each pair of words in the
	file. The remaining words are printed in an array.
	Entering 2 asks the user for two words. All words that alphanumerically
	come between the two words that the user enters will be removed and
	the remaining words are printed in an array.
	Entering 3 asks the user for another file with text. Enter the name
	of the other file (including extension). The program then prints
	in an array the text from the two files interleaved.
	Entering 4 asks the user for an integer n. This number represents the
	number of strings that are reversed in successive order from the file.
	The program prints in an array the result.
	Entering 5 reverses the contents of the file line by line, word by word
	while preserving the newline characters.
	Entering any other number will prompt the user that the input is
	invalid.

	The program will then ask the user if he/she would like to continue
	performing more manipulations. Enter any character to continue,
	otherwise enter the EOF keyboard sequence to quit.

SHORT RESPONSE
	1. We say the method implementation in the subclass OVERRIDES the
	   method in the superclass.
	2. We say these methods or ctors are OVERLOADED.
	3. The command is 
		mkdir -p fooDir/barDir
