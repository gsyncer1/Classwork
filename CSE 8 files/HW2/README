HOW TO RUN

When the program is started, it will prompt the user to enter text to be
converted into pig latin.

Enter any amount of text and press enter.
-The program should output the text translated into pig latin according
 to the following guidelines.

** Guidelines **
The translation has the following guidelines:
 -Main translation:
 1. If a word consists of only consonants, then the program does not
    translate the word into pig latin. The word stays the same (except
    for capitalization).
 2. If a word begins with a vowel, an "-ay" is simply appended at
    the end.
 3. If a word begins with a consonant, the initial consonant sound
    is moved to the end of the word appended with an "ay".
 4. Y is considered a vowel unless it is the first letter.

 -Capitalization:
 1. The first letter of each word is capitalized.
 2. In cases of words that start with consonants, the first consonant is
    converted to lower case when appended at the end.
 3. The cases of all other letters are preserved.


The program will keep prompting the user to enter more text until
an EOF keyboard sequence is entered, in which case the program quits.


SHORT RESPONSE
