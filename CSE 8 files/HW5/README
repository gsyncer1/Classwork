SHORT RESPONSE
	
	1. The this in regards to variables distinguishes between class
	   fields and formal parameters, as in constructors and mutator
	   methods.
	2. Static in regards to methods means that the method does not
	   require a calling object in order to be run. It can be called
	   without a reference qualifier.
	3. There is not this in static methods because they don't need to
	   refer to any class object.
