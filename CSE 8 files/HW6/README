HOW TO RUN
	This program does not take any inputs. Just compile one of the
	TestMickey or TestHouse files using javac and run the program. Once
	the program starts running, it opens a drawing panel showing the
	picture. TestMickey should show a simple picture of Mickey Mouse's
	head with the type and relevant dimensions of each shape drawn.
	TestMickeyWithDelays and TestHouseWithDelays all draw a Mickey Mouse
	character and House, respectively, with delays between the drawing of
	each shape. Text appears below the image saying what shape is
	being drawn and its relevant dimensions.

SHORT RESPONSE
	1. Java interfaces have no implementation while abstract classes may
	   have some implemented methods. Java interfaces use the interface
	   keyword in the definition while abstract classes use the keyword
	   abstract in the definition.
	2. Java interfaces and abstract classes both contain abstract methods.
	   They also have an is-a relationship.
	3. Type 
	   	gvim -p *.java 
	   to open all java source code files in the current directory, 
	   each in its own tab.
