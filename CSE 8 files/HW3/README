HOW TO RUN

	The program is a simple number guessing game. The program asks the user
	if he/she wants to play the game. Entering any character executes the
	game, while entering an EOF sequence quits the game.
	
	If the user indicates that he/she wants to play, the program asks for a
	range of integers from which to guess. The program then generates a 
	random number within the range for the user to guess.

	The user continually makes guesses. With each guess, the program tells
	the user if the guess is too high or too low. Once the user guesses 
	right, the program tell how many guesses it took to reach the correct 
	answer.

	The program then asks if the user wants to play again. If the user
	enters another character, then the game executes again.

	Once the user enters EOF to quit, the program displays how many games
	were played and what the average number of guesses per game was.
