HOW TO RUN

 TwoSmallest:
 -The program will prompt the user to enter a series of integers.
 -Once the user is done inputting integers, the user inputs an
  EOF keyboard sequence, triggering the program to analyze the
  numbers.

 -If no integers were entered, then the program indicates no
  integers were entered.
 -If only one distinct integer was entered, then the program
  will identify that integer as the smallest integer.
 -If at least two distinct integers were entered, then the
  program indicates the smallest and the next smallest integers.

 Triangles:
 -The program will prompt the user to enter the size of the
  triangles to be displayed.
 -The integer must be greater than or equal to 2. Otherwise,
  the program will keep asking for a valid integer.

 -Once a valid integer is entered, the program will print
  4 differently-oriented triangles next to each other with 
  side-lengths of the user's entered desired size.
