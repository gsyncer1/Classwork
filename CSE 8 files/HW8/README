HOW TO RUN:

-Reverse Recurse
	This program reverses the integers that a user enters using two different
	recursive methods

	Enter a maximum number of integers that you wish to enter. This value must
	be greater than 0. The java application will exit if you enter EOF or a non-
	integer input.

	The program will prompt you to enter up to how ever many integers you
	specified. Begin entering integers. You may enter EOF or a non-integer input
	at any time before you enter the maximum amount of integers.

	The program will display the results of the original array and the reversals
	of the array after you enter EOF, a non-integer input, or entering the
	maximum amount of integers.

-Print English
	This program prints the English words and letters of a number in the user-
	specified base.

	The program will prompt you to enter a number. Enter any integer.
	The program will then prompt you to enter a base for the number. The base
	must be between 2 and 36. (The program will prompt you to try again if
	the base you entered is invalid).

	It will then print the English words and letters of the number you entered
	in the base you entered.

	The program will then prompt you again to enter a number. Enter EOF at any
	time you see this prompt to quit.

SHORT RESPONSE
	1. The command >i{ will indent an entire curly-bracket block one level.
	   The command <i{ will de-indent the block/shift it back.
	2. To find the size in bytes of all files in the current directory in
	   ascending order, enter ls -l -S -r. -l displays the files in long format,
	   including file size. -S sorts according to file size in descending order.
	   -r reverses the order into ascending order.
