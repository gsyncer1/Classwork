HOW TO RUN
	This program will display statistics for a name that the user enters.
	Once the user enters a name, It displays, for every ten years from
	1880 to 2010, the number of females who had that name and the
	popularity rank of that name. It displays the same information for
	males.

	Once the program is running, it will ask whether the user wants to
	display statistics for a name. If the user wants to view statistics
	for a name, then the user should enter any character and press enter.
	(Otherwise, the user can enter EOF, which is <ctrl+d> on linux/mac os
	systems. This quits the program.)

	If the user enters a character, the program will ask the user for
	a baby name to display statistics for. Enter a name and press enter.
	The program will print a table displaying the statistics for that
	baby name.

	The program will keep on asking the user if he/she wants to view
	statistics for baby names and asks for the desired name if so.
